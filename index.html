								<b>Background</b>
								<br>Hi all! My name is Alexa Anderson, and I'm a third-year PhD student at the Institute for
								Astronomy at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. Though I was born in Tokyo, Japan, I grew up in
								the town of Kailua, Hawai'i. Later, I moved to New Haven to complete my undergraduate degree in 
								Astrophysics at Yale University.

								<b>Education</b>
								<br><b>M.S. Astronomy 2022</b>, Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawai'i at Mānoa,
								Honolulu, HI
								<br><b>B.S. Astrophysics 2020</b>, Yale University, New Haven, CT
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests</b>
								<br>My primary research interests are protoplanetary disks, as well as star and planet formation. I'm especially
								interested in the demographics of protoplanetary disk populations, in addition to the hot, inner, planet-forming
								regions of disks. In past projects, I've surveyed hundreds of protostars in Perseus and hundreds of protoplanetary
								disks in Serpens, as well as conducted in-depth studies on single objects, like the dipper RECX-11 (EP Cha). I 
								utilize a broad range of wavelength regimes (sub-mm to X-ray) in my studies, and hope to couple together NIR 
								spectroastrometry of disks with ALMA sub-mm observations to probe the physical structures within the inner-disk 
								for my thesis.

								<b>Mapping Protostellar Outflows in Perseus</b>
								<br><i>Advised by Dr. Hector Arce, Yale University</i>
								<br>I created moment 0 and contour maps from data cubes to identify protostellar outflows and morphologies in several

								<b>Satellite Galaxy Evolution in Colorspace</b>
								<br><i>Advised by Dr. Marla Geha, Yale University, Science, Technology, and Research (STARS) Summer fellow</i>
								<br>I studied
								the evolution of satellite galaxies in the summer of 2017. Using Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis modeling code, I analyzed how
								the colors of satellite galaxies in the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey would change over time. I presented my work
								at the <a href="https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/STARS%20Su17_Final%20Symposium%20Booklet_25Jul2017.pdf">
